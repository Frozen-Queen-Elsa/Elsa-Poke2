[Important] Give this whole readme a first read before attempting the setup.
*****************************************************************************
To make this version functional, refer the following:

1. After installing Python 3.8, first run the `setup.bat`. That should install the required 3rd party libraries.

Python 3.8.7: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.7/python-3.8.7-amd64.exe

If you are getting:
	A. "Python not found" error
	or
	B. an empty response,
go to Start -> Change/Uninstall Programs. Select Python 3.8 and choose Modify. While reinstalling, make sure "Add Python as Environment Variable" and "Add Python to Path" are checked.

2. In config.json:
	A. Replace your user token within the "".
	B. Replace "Enter your user id of your main account." with the id as an integer, i.e, get rid of the "".
To get the user ids, go to Discord Settings -> Appearance and Enable Dev Mode.
Then simply right-click on the user and Copy ID. 
	C. log_level has 4 options:
		1. Silent: No messages about catching.
		2. Print: Only prints to console upon catching.
		3. Priority: Only DMs owner when priority mon is caught, else logs to console.
		4. Default: All catches are logged in the DMs.

3. Create a fresh server and invite Poketwo to it. Then, use the P^setup_server command to automatically setup the channels and poketwo permissions for you. Make sure the bot account has admin/owner permissions in the server.

4. Use P^help while logged in as the owner account to see a list of all the commands along with their usage. 

5. Contact me on Discord for support. Have fun, play safe. :D

**Useful Tips**
===================
1. Poketwo might detect selfbot commands so we need to use the commands in channels hidden from Poketwo.
Do not spam/duel/trade/etc. without setting an active channel by using the P^channel command in a safe channel(#secret) first. Check out P^help channel for more details.

2. The autosleep feature is enabled by default.
Spamming will be disabled and catching will switch to Priority_only while the bot is sleeping.
You can use all other commands in the meantime if required.
Inter_sleep_delay is for how long you want the bot to run continuously before it autosleeps.
Sleep_duration is for how long you want it to autosleep.
Both the values are in seconds. For example, 2 hours = 2 * 60 * 60 = 7200 seconds.

3. The first thing you probably want to do is spam.
So, after the P^setup_server command is completed, in the secret channel, send these commands in the same order:
	P^channel add spam_channel_id
	P^toggle spam on
	P^spam

4. To quickly check the syntax and usage of a command, you can use P^help command_name, e.g., P^help spam

5. Configs can now be easily updated using Edit.bat in the Setup folder.

6. Due to the recent poketwo update, bot will autosleep for a day after catching 990 - 995 pokemons to bypass the captcha. If you verify the captcha manually, you can wake it up with P^verified.
